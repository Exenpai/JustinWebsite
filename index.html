    <h2>Fact #1</h2>
    <p>My name is Justin Serrano and I was born in the Philippines (April 15, 1998). Then, I came to Canada. I moved to
        Montreal, Quebec at the age of 2 and moved again to Calgary, Alberta at the age of 11.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Fact #2</h2>
    <p>I like to dance. I perform at events with my dance group and sometimes with friends just for fun. At first, I
        didn't really enjoy dancing as a kid because it was a source of entertainment for family parties and adults
        would enjoy watching me dance. As I got older, I got back to dancing and took part in talent shows, which
        catalyzed my motivation to dance more.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h2>Fact #3</h2>
    <p>I like KPOP. My friends and I made a YouTube channel dedicated to us dancing to KPOP songs and our group is
        called NEVER. Please follow our
        YouTube channel and Instagram @neverofficialyyc.</p>
