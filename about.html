    <div id="about">
        <h2>Fact #1</h2>
        <p>My name is Justin Serrano and I was born in the Philippines (April 15, 1998). Then, I came to Canada. I moved
            to Montreal, Quebec at the age of 2 and moved again to Calgary, Alberta at the age of 11.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Fact #2</h2>
        <p>I like to dance. I perform at events with my dance group and sometimes with friends just for fun. As a kid, I
            didn't really enjoy dancing because I wasn't really good at it. I was forced to dance as a source of
            entertainment for family parties and adults
            would enjoy watching me awkwardly dance. As I got older, I got back to dancing and took part in talent
            shows which sparked my interest in dancing.</p>

        <h2>Fact #3</h2>
        <p>I like KPOP. My friends and I made a YouTube channel dedicated of us dancing to KPOP songs and our group is
            called NEVER Official. Please follow our YouTube channel
